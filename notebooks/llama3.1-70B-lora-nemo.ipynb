    "## Estimating GPU Memory Requirements for Serving LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Model Size**\n",
    "Before you begin, it’s essential to understand how much GPU memory you’ll need to serve a large language model (LLM). A commonly used formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{model}} = \\frac{(P \\times 4B)}{(32 / Q)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **M**: The GPU memory required (in Gigabytes)  \n",
    "- **P**: The number of parameters in the model (e.g., 7 billion parameters for a 7B model)  \n",
    "- **4B**: 4 bytes, representing the size of each parameter at full precision (32 bits)  \n",
    "- **32**: The number of bits in 4 bytes (32 bits)  \n",
    "- **Q**: The model precision in bits used during serving (e.g., 16 bits, 8 bits, or 4 bits)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with $P \\times 4B$ to get the base memory needed for all parameters at full precision (FP32).\n",
    "- Divide by $(32/Q)$, which scales the memory requirement according to the lower-precision format you’re using. For example, loading a model in 16-bit precision effectively halves the memory usage compared to 32-bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 70B parameter model loaded in 8-bit precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P = 70 \\times 10^9$ ($70$ billion)\n",
    "- $Q = 8$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging these in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{model}} = \\frac{(70 \\times 10^9 \\times 4B)}{(32 / 8)} \n",
    "= \\frac{(280 \\times 10^9 B)}{2} \n",
    "= 70 \\times 10^9 B\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert bytes to gigabytes (1 GB = $10^9$ bytes):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = 70 \\text{ GB}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rough calculation helps estimate the GPU memory needed for serving large models, ensuring you have the right hardware configuration before starting fine-tuning or inference steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Context Window**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **context window** refers to the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) the model can process in a single inference pass. During inference, the model needs to store activations for each token in the input sequence. This storage requirement scales linearly with the length of the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Memory Calculation for Context Window**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{context}} = L \\times H \\times D \\times N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{context}}$**: Memory required for the context window (in Gigabytes)\n",
    "- **$L$**: Length of the context window (number of tokens)\n",
    "- **$H$**: Hidden size (dimensionality of the model's hidden layers)\n",
    "- **$D$**: Data type size (bytes per element, e.g., 2 for FP16)\n",
    "- **$N$**: Number of transformer layers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume:\n",
    "- **$L = 1024$** tokens\n",
    "- **$H = 8192$** dimensions\n",
    "- **$D = 1$** bytes (for INT8 precision)\n",
    "- **$N = 80$** number of hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{context}} = 1024 \\times 8192 \\times 1 \\times 80 = 671,088,640 \\text{ bytes} \\approx 671 \\text{ MB}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Batch Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch size** determines how many input sequences the model processes simultaneously. Increasing the batch size can lead to higher GPU memory usage because the model needs to store activations for each sequence in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Memory Calculation for Batch Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{batch}} = B \\times M_{\\text{context}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{batch}}$**: Additional memory required for batching (in Gigabytes)\n",
    "- **$B$**: Batch size (number of sequences)\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{context}}$**: Memory per sequence (from context window calculation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the previous **$M_{\\text{context}} =  671 \\text{ MB}$** and a **batch size $B = 8$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{batch}} = 8 \\times  671 \\text{ MB} = 5.4 \\text{ GB}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Total Inference Memory Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all these factors gives a more comprehensive estimate of the GPU memory required for inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{total}} = M_{\\text{model}} + M_{\\text{context}} \\times B + M_{\\text{overhead}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{total}}$**: Total GPU memory required (in Gigabytes)\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{model}}$**: Memory for the model\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{context}}$**: Memory per token sequence\n",
    "- **$B$**: Batch size\n",
    "- **$M_{\\text{overhead}}$**: Additional overhead for operations like caching, temporary buffers, etc. (typically 10-20%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the previous results:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{total}} \\approx 90 \\text{ GB}\n",
